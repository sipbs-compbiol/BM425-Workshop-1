## Using data in Galaxy

For Galaxy to be able to use your data, that **data must be in your _history_ on the Galaxy instance**.
:::

::: { .callout-caution }
Data is not shared between Galaxy instances. For instance, if you upload data to `usegalaxy.eu` it will _not_ automatically be available on `usegalaxy.org` or `usegalaxy.au`.
:::

## Uploading your data

There are three main routes to uploading your data onto the Galaxy instance.

### Drag and drop data onto the workspace


### Use the `Upload Data` button in the `Tools` sidebar


### Use the `Load your own data` link in an empty workflow

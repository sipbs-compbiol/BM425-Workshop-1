               predominantly through free-to-use services, supporting
               user-driven research that broadens in scope each year. Users are
               attracted to public Galaxy services by platform stability, tool
               and reference dataset diversity, training, support and
               integration, which enables complex, reproducible, shareable data
               analysis. Applying the principles of user experience design
               (UXD), has driven improvements in accessibility, tool
               discoverability through Galaxy Labs/subdomains, and a redesigned
               Galaxy ToolShed. Galaxy tool capabilities are progressing in two
               strategic directions: integrating general purpose graphical
               processing units (GPGPU) access for cutting-edge methods, and
               licensed tool support. Engagement with global research consortia
               is being increased by developing more workflows in Galaxy and by
               resourcing the public Galaxy services to run them. The Galaxy
               Training Network (GTN) portfolio has grown in both size, and
               accessibility, through learning paths and direct integration
               with Galaxy tools that feature in training courses. Code
               development continues in line with the Galaxy Project roadmap,
               with improvements to job scheduling and the user interface.
               Environmental impact assessment is also helping engage users and
               developers, reminding them of their role in sustainability, by
               displaying estimated CO2 emissions generated by each Galaxy job.",

               mathematical modelling study",

               Hogan, Alexandra B and Winskill, Peter and Ghani, Azra C",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The first COVID-19 vaccine outside a clinical trial
               setting was administered on Dec 8, 2020. To ensure global
               vaccine equity, vaccine targets were set by the COVID-19
               Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility and WHO. However, due to
               vaccine shortfalls, these targets were not achieved by the end
               of 2021. We aimed to quantify the global impact of the first
               year of COVID-19 vaccination programmes. METHODS: A mathematical
               model of COVID-19 transmission and vaccination was separately
               fit to reported COVID-19 mortality and all-cause excess
               mortality in 185 countries and territories. The impact of
               COVID-19 vaccination programmes was determined by estimating the
               additional lives lost if no vaccines had been distributed. We
               also estimated the additional deaths that would have been
               averted had the vaccination coverage targets of 20\% set by
               COVAX and 40\% set by WHO been achieved by the end of 2021.
               FINDINGS: Based on official reported COVID-19 deaths, we
               estimated that vaccinations prevented 14·4 million (95\%
               credible interval [Crl] 13·7-15·9) deaths from COVID-19 in 185
               countries and territories between Dec 8, 2020, and Dec 8, 2021.
               This estimate rose to 19·8 million (95\% Crl 19·1-20·4) deaths
               from COVID-19 averted when we used excess deaths as an estimate
               of the true extent of the pandemic, representing a global
               reduction of 63\% in total deaths (19·8 million of 31·4 million)
               during the first year of COVID-19 vaccination. In COVAX Advance
               Market Commitment countries, we estimated that 41\% of excess
               mortality (7·4 million [95\% Crl 6·8-7·7] of 17·9 million
               deaths) was averted. In low-income countries, we estimated that
               an additional 45\% (95\% CrI 42-49) of deaths could have been
               averted had the 20\% vaccination coverage target set by COVAX
               been met by each country, and that an additional 111\% (105-118)
               of deaths could have been averted had the 40\% target set by WHO
               been met by each country by the end of 2021. INTERPRETATION:
               COVID-19 vaccination has substantially altered the course of the
               pandemic, saving tens of millions of lives globally. However,
               inadequate access to vaccines in low-income countries has
               limited the impact in these settings, reinforcing the need for
               global vaccine equity and coverage. FUNDING: Schmidt Science

               currently spreading across the world. It is caused by a novel
               coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
               (SARS-CoV-2). The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which plays a
               key role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion
               process, is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit
               contains a receptor-binding domain that recognizes and binds to
               the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, while the S2
               subunit mediates viral cell membrane fusion by forming a
               six-helical bundle via the two-heptad repeat domain. In this
               review, we highlight recent research advance in the structure,

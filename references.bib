               user-driven research that broadens in scope each year. Users are
               attracted to public Galaxy services by platform stability, tool
               and reference dataset diversity, training, support and
               integration, which enables complex, reproducible, shareable data
               analysis. Applying the principles of user experience design
               (UXD), has driven improvements in accessibility, tool
               discoverability through Galaxy Labs/subdomains, and a redesigned
               Galaxy ToolShed. Galaxy tool capabilities are progressing in two
               strategic directions: integrating general purpose graphical
               processing units (GPGPU) access for cutting-edge methods, and
               licensed tool support. Engagement with global research consortia
               is being increased by developing more workflows in Galaxy and by
               resourcing the public Galaxy services to run them. The Galaxy
               Training Network (GTN) portfolio has grown in both size, and
               accessibility, through learning paths and direct integration
               with Galaxy tools that feature in training courses. Code
               development continues in line with the Galaxy Project roadmap,
               with improvements to job scheduling and the user interface.
               Environmental impact assessment is also helping engage users and

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The first COVID-19 vaccine outside a clinical trial
               setting was administered on Dec 8, 2020. To ensure global
               vaccine equity, vaccine targets were set by the COVID-19
               Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility and WHO. However, due to
               vaccine shortfalls, these targets were not achieved by the end
               of 2021. We aimed to quantify the global impact of the first
               year of COVID-19 vaccination programmes. METHODS: A mathematical
               model of COVID-19 transmission and vaccination was separately
               fit to reported COVID-19 mortality and all-cause excess
               mortality in 185 countries and territories. The impact of
               COVID-19 vaccination programmes was determined by estimating the
               additional lives lost if no vaccines had been distributed. We
               also estimated the additional deaths that would have been
               averted had the vaccination coverage targets of 20\% set by
               COVAX and 40\% set by WHO been achieved by the end of 2021.
               FINDINGS: Based on official reported COVID-19 deaths, we
               estimated that vaccinations prevented 14·4 million (95\%
               credible interval [Crl] 13·7-15·9) deaths from COVID-19 in 185
               countries and territories between Dec 8, 2020, and Dec 8, 2021.
               This estimate rose to 19·8 million (95\% Crl 19·1-20·4) deaths
               from COVID-19 averted when we used excess deaths as an estimate
               of the true extent of the pandemic, representing a global
               reduction of 63\% in total deaths (19·8 million of 31·4 million)
               during the first year of COVID-19 vaccination. In COVAX Advance
               Market Commitment countries, we estimated that 41\% of excess
               mortality (7·4 million [95\% Crl 6·8-7·7] of 17·9 million
               deaths) was averted. In low-income countries, we estimated that
               an additional 45\% (95\% CrI 42-49) of deaths could have been
               averted had the 20\% vaccination coverage target set by COVAX
               been met by each country, and that an additional 111\% (105-118)
               of deaths could have been averted had the 40\% target set by WHO
               been met by each country by the end of 2021. INTERPRETATION:
               COVID-19 vaccination has substantially altered the course of the
               pandemic, saving tens of millions of lives globally. However,
               inadequate access to vaccines in low-income countries has
               limited the impact in these settings, reinforcing the need for
               global vaccine equity and coverage. FUNDING: Schmidt Science

               and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable
               uncertainty. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported
               in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. As of 25 January 2020, at least
               1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was
               hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations
               have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood
               market in Wuhan. Here we study a single patient who was a worker
               at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of
               Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe
               respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.

               Galaxy tools for large scale analysis of gene and protein
               sequences. The motivating research theme is the identification
               of specific genes of interest in a range of non-model organisms,
               and our central example is the identification and prediction of
               ``effector'' proteins produced by plant pathogens in order to
               manipulate their host plant. This functional annotation of a
               pathogen's predicted capacity for virulence is a key step in
               translating sequence data into potential applications in plant
               pathology. This collection includes novel tools, and widely-used
               third-party tools such as NCBI BLAST+ wrapped for use within
               Galaxy. Individual bioinformatics software tools are typically
               available separately as standalone packages, or in online

               combine these and other tools to automate organism scale
               analyses as workflows, without demanding familiarity with
               command line tools and scripting. Workflows created using Galaxy

               cultivated microbial isolates and for single-cell genomic DNA
               sequencing. With time, the functionality of SPAdes was extended
               to enable assembly of IonTorrent data, as well as hybrid
               assembly from short and long reads (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore).
               In this article we present protocols for five different assembly
               pipelines that comprise the SPAdes package and that are used for
               assembly of metagenomes and transcriptomes as well as assembly
               of putative plasmids and biosynthetic gene clusters from
               whole-genome sequencing and metagenomic datasets. In addition,
               we present guidelines for understanding results with use cases
               for each pipeline, and several additional support protocols that
               help in using SPAdes properly. \copyright{} 2020 Wiley

  abstract  = "UNLABELLED: Although de novo assembly graphs contain assembled
               contigs (nodes), the connections between those contigs (edges)
               are difficult for users to access. Bandage (a Bioinformatics
               Application for Navigating De novo Assembly Graphs Easily) is a
               tool for visualizing assembly graphs with connections. Users can
               zoom in to specific areas of the graph and interact with it by
               moving nodes, adding labels, changing colors and extracting
               sequences. BLAST searches can be performed within the Bandage
               graphical user interface and the hits are displayed as
               highlights in the graph. By displaying connections between
               contigs, Bandage presents new possibilities for analyzing de
               novo assemblies that are not possible through investigation of
               contigs alone. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code and
               binaries are freely available at

  abstract  = "UNLABELLED: The multiplex capability and high yield of current
               day DNA-sequencing instruments has made bacterial whole genome
               sequencing a routine affair. The subsequent de novo assembly of
               reads into contigs has been well addressed. The final step of
               annotating all relevant genomic features on those contigs can be
               achieved slowly using existing web- and email-based systems, but
               these are not applicable for sensitive data or integrating into
               computational pipelines. Here we introduce Prokka, a command
               line software tool to fully annotate a draft bacterial genome in
               about 10 min on a typical desktop computer. It produces
               standards-compliant output files for further analysis or viewing
               in genome browsers. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Prokka is

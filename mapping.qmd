# Read Mapping {@sec-mapping .unnumbered}

There are several approaches to comparison of genome sequences. One method is to align (or _map_) the sequenced reads from one genome to a different, reference genome. Reads will only _map to_ (align with) sequence-similar regions, so it is possible to inspect the alignments and see which parts of the two genomes are similar or dissimilar.

# Clean Raw Read Data {#sec-trimmomatic}

As you have seen in @sec-fastqc sequence read data can be of variable quality. The usual approach to improving the overall quality of a dataset is to discard low quality reads, and low-quality sections of reads. This is referred to as _cleaning_ raw read data.

`Trimmomatic` is a commonly-used software tool for cleaning raw read data that

1. identifies and excludes (_drops_) low-quality reads
2. trims (_deletes_) any remaining Illumina adapter sequences
3. trims (_deletes_) any low-quality read ends

## Good practice

It is good practice always to use a tool like `trimmomatic` to clean your raw sequencing data.

When reporting how you cleaned your sequence data in a manuscript or dissertation, you should always state:

1. The software tool you used, with its version number and a citation of the paper describing it (if available; provide a URL to the software if there is no paper)
2. The parameters used when running the tool (if default parameters were used, state this)
3. The number of reads that remained after cleaning

Tools like `trimmomatic` return two kinds of cleaned read data:

1. R1-paired, R2-paired: these are high quality paired-end reads
2. R1-unpaired, R2-unpaired: these are single reads, where one member of the read pair was low quality

This part of the workshop will guide you through using `trimmomatic` to clear your sequence read data.

## Using `trimmomatic`

1. Navigate to the `trimmomatic` tool using the `Tools` sidebar in `Galaxy`
  - You can use the `search tools` field to find `trimmomatic`, or look under the `FASTA/FASTQ` section in the sidebar
2. Select the `trimmomatic` tool
3. Make sure that `Paired-end (two separate input files)` is chosen
4. Select the forward and reverse raw read sets (`trimmed_pe_aln.qsorted.mapped.fixed.1.fastq.gz` `trimmed_pe_aln.qsorted.mapped.fixed.2.fastq.gz`) as the `Input FASTQ file`s
5. Set `Perform initial ILLUMINACLIP` to `Yes`; this will trim any remaining Illumina adapters from the read sequences
6. Under `Adapter sequences to use` select `TruSeq3 (paired-ended for MiSeq and HiSeq)`
7. Click `Run Tool`

## `trimmomatic` Output

Cleaning your data with `trimmomatic` generates four output files (@fig-trimmomatic-output-list).

![`FastQC` output files in Galaxy. From the top: unpaired reverse (R2) reads, unpaired forward (R1) reads, paired reverse (R2) reads, and paired forward (R1) reads.](assets/images/trimmomatic_output_list.png){#fig-trimmomatic-output-list}
:::

You can inspect the contents of these files by clicking on the filename in the `History` sidebar, and also by clicking on the corresponding `eye` icon to view the trimmed reads in the workspace.

## Next steps

Now that we have clean, high-quality sequencing reads, we can move on to assembling the SARS-CoV-2 genome, in @sec-shovill.

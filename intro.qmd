# Introduction

## Workshop Scope

Today you will be:

- assembling, annotating, and visualising the first SARS-CoV-2 genome to be sequenced (from Wuhan, January 2020).
- comparing the first SARS-CoV-2 genome to an earlier coronavirus (SARS 2003)
- comparing the first SARS-CoV-2 genome and a SARS-CoV-2 genome that was sequenced later in the pandemic
- interpreting the biological signifance of differences between the genomes, particularly in the region of the spike (S) protein.

## COVID-19

The first cases of a pneumonia of unknown causes began to emerge in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was isolated by early January, and by the end of January 2020 human-to-human transmission had been confirmed, and cases had been reported in Thailand, Japan, the USA, and several other countries (@Wang2020-yy).

By the end of February, cases had been identified across the Northern hemisphere, and a new hotspot was emerging in Italy.

By October 2021, it was estimated that COVID-19 had [caused over 5mn deaths](https://www.reuters.com/world/global-covid-19-deaths-hit-5-million-delta-variant-sweeps-world-2021-10-02/) worldwide, as well as severe social and economic disruption, including the [largest global recession in almost a century](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2020/04/14/blog-weo-the-great-lockdown-worst-economic-downturn-since-the-great-depression).

Despite this huge impact, societal and scientific efforts including lockdowns, mathematical modelling, and novel vaccine development helped avoid even worse outcomes. COVID-19 vaccines are estimated to have prevented an additional 14-20mn deaths worldwide in 2021 (@Watson2022-ec).

In May 2023, the World Health Organisation (WHO) [ended their Public Health Emergency](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/covid-is-no-longer-global-health-emergency-who-2023-05-05/) of International Concern (PHEIC), but the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains in circulation. As we begin this workshop, SARS-CoV-2 has [claimed over 7mn lives](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) (@owidcoronavirus).

## SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) Protein

The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a central role in host cell receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion (@Huang2020-uk). The protein comprises two subunits:

- S1: a receptor-binding domain that recognises and binds ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2)
- S2: a domain that mediates membrane fusion between the virus and the cell by forming a structural bundle

The S protein attaches to the ACE receptor _via_ the S1 subunit, and the S2 subunit then forms a structural bundle, interacting with the host cell to permit virus entry."}
When you assemble, annotate, and visualise the SARS-CoV-2 genome in this workshop you will find the spike protein annotated.

The spike protein is not the only important surface protein for SARS-CoV-2. The envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid proteins are also essential for the virus to interact with the host, and you will identify these in your analysis today, too.

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was isolated by early January, and by the end of January 2020 human-to-human transmission had been confirmed, and cases had been reported in Thailand, Japan, the USA, and several other countries (Figure 1.1, Wang et al. (2020)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Early COVID-19 timeline (reproduced from Wang et al. (2020))\n\n\n\nBy the end of February, cases had been identified across the Northern hemisphere, and a new hotspot was emerging in Italy (Figure 1.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Early COVID-19 global spread\n\n\n\nBy October 2021, it was estimated that COVID-19 had caused over 5mn deaths worldwide, as well as severe social and economic disruption, including the largest global recession in almost a century.\nDespite this huge impact, societal and scientific efforts including lockdowns, mathematical modelling, and novel vaccine development - much of it supported by widespread genome analysis of the kind you will perform today - helped avoid even worse outcomes. COVID-19 vaccines are estimated to have prevented an additional 14-20mn deaths worldwide in 2021 (Watson et al. (2022)).\nIn May 2023, the World Health Organisation (WHO) ended their Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), but the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains in circulation. As we begin this workshop, SARS-CoV-2 has claimed over 7mn lives (Mathieu et al. (2020)).",

The protein comprises two subunits:\n\nS1: a receptor-binding domain that recognises and binds ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2)\nS2: a domain that mediates membrane fusion between the virus and the cell by forming a structural bundle\n\nThese interact with the host cell as illustrated in Figure 1.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: (a) The schematic structure of the S protein.

    "section": "1.4 Data Provenance",
    "text": "1.4 Data Provenance\nModern scientific research, and this workshop, are both made possible due to the dedication of scientists around the globe to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible) principles for scientific data management.\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 sequence and structural data was released through public repositories including NCBI, GISAID, and RCSB/PDB. The data shared through these resources enabled scientists across the world to conduct research that reduced suffering and hastened the end of the pandemic. These practices were established before COVID-19, and continue to support and empower scientific research globally.\n\n1.4.1 The first sequenced human COVID-19 case\nThe first SARS-CoV-2 genome was obtained from a sample of human lung in January 2020. The sample was sequenced and submitted to NCBI as SAMN13922059. It is recorded as “human lung metagenome” because the entire material - human, virus, and everything else - was sequenced as a single sample. The work as described in Wu et al. (2020) is outlined below.\n\nThe lung was lavaged (washed/rinsed) and the fluid collected\nTotal RNA was extracted from the fluid, and an RNA sequencing library constructed (including depletion of ribosomal RNA)\nThe library was sequenced on an Illumina MiniSeq machine, to give 150bp paired-end reads\nThe resulting reads were cleaned and assembled using Megahit (Li et al. (2015)) and Trinity\nThe longest assembled contig was identified as a coronavirus, and used to design primers for PCR-RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends, Pal (2022), Figure 1.6) which allowed researchers to sequence the ends of the virus genome\nThe cleaned reads were remapped against the full virus sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: PCR-RACE generates long amplicons from the viral genome, which can be sequenced with long-read sequencing. This results in a “crenellated” assembly of overlapping long genomic sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nWhy did the researchers extract RNA and not DNA?\nWhy do you think the researchers depleted the ribosomal RNA?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, so we must sequence RNA in order to recover the virus genome. Sequencing DNA would not include any virus sequence.\nThere is so much ribosomal RNA in biological material that, if it was left in the sample, it would dominate over the viral material and any human transcripts. Most of the resulting sequence would describe the ribosome, not the virus or host genome, making the virus more difficult to detect. Depleting ribosomal RNA enhances sensitivity for detecting viral RNA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 SARS-CoV-2 read data for this workshop\nFor this workshop, we downloaded the 57mn raw sequencing reads from Wu et al. (2020), which are available at NCBI under accession SRR10971381, and filtered out all reads that matched the human genome. The remaining reads in the files below are those you will use to assemble the SARS-CoV-2 genome.\n\nPaired-end reads, forward direction\nPaired-end reads, reverse direction\n\n\n\n1.4.3 SARS-CoV 2003 genome data for this workshop\nThe first comparator genome in the workshop is that of SARS coronavirus Urbani. This coronavirus emerged in Guangdong, China, in late 2002 and was the subject of a World Health Organisation global alert, which named it SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). This strain of SARS-CoV was sequenced in 2003 (Rota et al. (2003)) and has accession AY278741.1 at GenBank/NCBI.\nIn the workshop, you will use the following files:\n\nSARS 2003 genome sequence (.fasta)\nSARS 2003 annotation (.gff3)\nSARS 2003 combined genome sequence and annotation (.gbk)\n\n\n\n1.4.4 March 2020 Dutch SARS-CoV-2 isolate\nThe second comparator genome you will use in this workshop is a SARS-CoV-2 variant sequenced in the Netherlands in March 2020, four months after the first known human cases were identified. The sample has accession SAMEA6847958 and was obtained through active surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic (Oude Munnink et al. (2020)).\nThe data describes a set of Oxford Nanopore (ONT) GridION reads, which are available under accession ERR4164769 at SRA/NCBI. In this workshop, you will use the following file:\n\nGridION reads for March 2020 Dutch isolate\n\n\n\n\n\nHuang, Yuan, Chan Yang, Xin-Feng Xu, Wei Xu, and Shu-Wen Liu. 2020. “Structural and Functional Properties of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein: Potential Antivirus Drug Development for COVID-19.” Acta Pharmacol.

Each such installation is called a Galaxy instance. The Galaxy instance that you will be working on is the EU Galaxy instance at https://usegalaxy.eu/. This is the largest Galaxy instance in Europe and gives access to over 2500 scientific tools. It is free to use, and is maintained by the Galaxy team at Freiburg.\nThere are many other Galaxy instances, some private, and some public and free for anyone to use, such as:\n\nhttps://usegalaxy.org/: The Galaxy Project public server, supporting biomedical research.\nhttps://galaxyproject.org/use/usegalaxy-fr/: A general-purpose Galaxy server, based in France\nhttps://galaxyproject.org/use/usegalaxy-au/: The Australian UseGalaxy server\n\nGalaxy can be thought of as a library of bioinformatics tools and, just as different libraries may contain differing collections of books, each Galaxy instance may make available different sets of tools, or different versions of similar tools. As a result some analyses may be possible on one Galaxy instance, but not another.\nWhen you use Galaxy it is important to be clear when writing up your analysis methods to be clear about which Galaxy instance is used, and which version of each tool was used in the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Workflows\nThe key concept in Galaxy is the workflow. A workflow is a series, or chain, of analysis steps that takes some input data (one or more files or datasets) through a series of actions, to generate one or more result files. Typically, the output of one step will serve as the input to the next step, but more complicated branching workflows can also be created (Figure 2.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Galaxy workflow editor view of a Galaxy workflow that runs the same tool (RXLR Motifs) with three different settings, and compares the results using a Venn diagram (reproduced from Cock et al. (2013)). The workflow runs from left to right. A single Input dataset is fed into the RXLR Motifs tool three times, applying a different method each time. Each run of the RXLR Motifs tool generates a different set of output sequences, which are passed as input to the Filter tool. The output from all three runs of the Filter tool is passed to the Venn Diagram tool, along with the original input dataset, to generate a Venn Diagram\n\n\n\nUsing Galaxy, you will build up a powerful bioinformatic analysis workflow to analyse your data, step-by-step, using a web browser. Galaxy allows you to save and share your workflows, to encourage reuse and reproducibility.",

    "text": "6.2 FastQC output\nThe output of FastQC tells us a lot about the quality of our sequencing data, and we would typically use it to identify problems with our sequencing data. Some important sections are described below, and you can read more about how to diagnose quality issues in your dataset at the links below:\n\nOfficial FastQC documentation\nMichigan State University (MSU) FastQC tutorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo: Inspecting FastQC output in Galaxy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.1 FastQC Summary\nThe FastQC summary (Figure 6.1) provides an overview that indicates where there may be areas of concern in your data. Each section of the report receives a flag indicating either that it gets a pass (green, with a tick), a warning (amber, with exclamation mark), or a fail (red, with a cross) mark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Example FastQC summary showing passes for most sections of the report including “Basic Statistics,” warnings for some sections including “Overrepresented sequences,” and a fail for “Sequence Duplication Levels”\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Per base sequence quality\nThe per base sequence quality plot (Figure 6.2) presents the ranges of individual base quality calls across the lengths of the input sequence reads. Higher scores (near 40) indicate better quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor good-quality sequence read data, we are looking for a graph where the mean quality (see Figure 6.2) is always in the green area, with a score greater than 29.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Per base sequence quality score plot from FastQC indicating high quality sequencing reads. Quality score ranges are presented as a boxplot, with the mean drawn as a line connecting each boxplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIt is not unusual for the per-base quality scores to fall quite steeply towards the end of the reads, with Illumina and other sequencing technologies.\nIt is also typical for the quality score to be slightly lower in the first 5-7 bases of the read.\nIf mean quality per base falls below 29, there may be a problem with the sequencing data.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Per sequence quality scores\nThe per sequence quality score (Figure 6.3) summarises the distribution of high quality (higher scores, near 40) and lower quality reads in the complete dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn good quality sequence data, we tend to see a sharp peak towards the right hand side of the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Per sequence quality score plot from FastQC indicating overall high quality sequencing reads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIf the per sequence quality score appears flat, or plateaus towards the left hand side of the plot, there may be a problem with the sequencing data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\n\nThe FastQC Sequence Duplication Levels section is marked as a fail in one of the output result files. Why do you think this is?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the description of the Sequence Duplication Levels result section in the MSU Tutorial.\nRead the description of the provenance of your read data in Chapter 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\n\n\n\n\nYour sequence reads were obtained using RNA sequencing, and very deeply sequenced the virus genome. The high abundance of virus sequence reads (and the low abundance of any reads that do not derive from the virus) looks unusual compared to the results of a standard DNA genome sequencing experiment, so is marked as “fail” by FastQC.",

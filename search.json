The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was isolated by early January, and by the end of January 2020 human-to-human transmission had been confirmed, and cases had been reported in Thailand, Japan, the USA, and several other countries (Figure 1.1, Wang et al.

COVID-19 vaccines are estimated to have prevented an additional 14-20mn deaths worldwide in 2021 (Watson et al.

The protein comprises two subunits:\n\nS1: a receptor-binding domain that recognises and binds ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2)\nS2: a domain that mediates membrane fusion between the virus and the cell by forming a structural bundle\n\nThese interact with the host cell as illustrated in Figure 1.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: (a) The schematic structure of the S protein.

    "section": "1.4 Data Provenance",
    "text": "1.4 Data Provenance\nModern scientific research, and this workshop, are both made possible due to the dedication of scientists around the globe to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible) principles for scientific data management.\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 sequence and structural data was released through public repositories including NCBI, GISAID, and RCSB/PDB. The data shared through these resources enabled scientists across the world to conduct research that reduced suffering and hastened the end of the pandemic. These practices were established before COVID-19, and continue to support and empower scientific research globally.\n\n1.4.1 The first sequenced human COVID-19 case\nThe first SARS-CoV-2 genome was obtained from a sample of human lung in January 2020. The sample was sequenced and submitted to NCBI as SAMN13922059. It is recorded as “human lung metagenome” because the entire material - human, virus, and everything else - was sequenced as a single sample. The work as described in Wu et al. (2020) is outlined below.\n\nThe lung was lavaged (washed/rinsed) and the fluid collected\nTotal RNA was extracted from the fluid, and an RNA sequencing library constructed (including depletion of ribosomal RNA)\nThe library was sequenced on an Illumina MiniSeq machine, to give 150bp paired-end reads\nThe resulting reads were cleaned and assembled using Megahit (Li et al. (2015)) and Trinity\nThe longest assembled contig was identified as a coronavirus, and used to design primers for PCR-RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends, Pal (2022), Figure 1.6) which allowed researchers to sequence the ends of the virus genome\nThe cleaned reads were remapped against the full virus sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: PCR-RACE generates long amplicons from the viral genome, which can be sequenced with long-read sequencing. This results in a “crenellated” assembly of overlapping long genomic sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nWhy did the researchers extract RNA and not DNA?\nWhy do you think the researchers depleted the ribosomal RNA?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, so we must sequence RNA in order to recover the virus genome. Sequencing DNA would not include any virus sequence.\nThere is so much ribosomal RNA in biological material that, if it was left in the sample, it would dominate over the viral material and any human transcripts. Most of the resulting sequence would describe the ribosome, not the virus or host genome, making the virus more difficult to detect. Depleting ribosomal RNA enhances sensitivity for detecting viral RNA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 SARS-CoV-2 read data for this workshop\nFor this workshop, we downloaded the 57mn raw sequencing reads from Wu et al. (2020), which are available at NCBI under accession SRR10971381, and filtered out all reads that matched the human genome. The remaining reads in the files below are those you will use to assemble the SARS-CoV-2 genome.\n\nPaired-end reads, forward direction\nPaired-end reads, reverse direction\n\n\n\n1.4.3 SARS-CoV 2003 genome data for this workshop\nThe first comparator genome in the workshop is that of SARS coronavirus Urbani. This coronavirus emerged in Guangdong, China, in late 2002 and was the subject of a World Health Organisation global alert, which named it SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). This strain of SARS-CoV was sequenced in 2003 (Rota et al. (2003)) and has accession AY278741.1 at GenBank/NCBI.\nIn the workshop, you will use the following files:\n\nSARS 2003 genome sequence (.fasta)\nSARS 2003 annotation (.gff3)\nSARS 2003 combined genome sequence and annotation (.gbk)\n\n\n\n1.4.4 March 2020 Dutch SARS-CoV-2 isolate\nThe second comparator genome you will use in this workshop is a SARS-CoV-2 variant sequenced in the Netherlands in March 2020, four months after the first known human cases were identified. The sample has accession SAMEA6847958 and was obtained through active surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic (Oude Munnink et al. (2020)).\nThe data describes a set of Oxford Nanopore (ONT) GridION reads, which are available under accession ERR4164769 at SRA/NCBI. In this workshop, you will use the following file:\n\nGridION reads for March 2020 Dutch isolate\n\n\n\n\n\nHuang, Yuan, Chan Yang, Xin-Feng Xu, Wei Xu, and Shu-Wen Liu. 2020. “Structural and Functional Properties of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein: Potential Antivirus Drug Development for COVID-19.” Acta Pharmacol.

Each such installation is called a Galaxy instance. The Galaxy instance that you will be working on is the EU Galaxy instance at https://usegalaxy.eu/. This is the largest Galaxy instance in Europe and gives access to over 2500 scientific tools. It is free to use, and is maintained by the Galaxy team at Freiburg.\nThere are many other Galaxy instances, some private, and some public and free for anyone to use, such as:\n\nhttps://usegalaxy.org/: The Galaxy Project public server, supporting biomedical research.\nhttps://galaxyproject.org/use/usegalaxy-fr/: A general-purpose Galaxy server, based in France\nhttps://galaxyproject.org/use/usegalaxy-au/: The Australian UseGalaxy server\n\nGalaxy can be thought of as a library of bioinformatics tools and, just as different libraries may contain differing collections of books, each Galaxy instance may make available different sets of tools, or different versions of similar tools. As a result some analyses may be possible on one Galaxy instance, but not another.\nWhen you use Galaxy it is important to be clear when writing up your analysis methods to be clear about which Galaxy instance is used, and which version of each tool was used in the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Workflows\nThe key concept in Galaxy is the workflow. A workflow is a series, or chain, of analysis steps that takes some input data (one or more files or datasets) through a series of actions, to generate one or more result files. Typically, the output of one step will serve as the input to the next step, but more complicated branching workflows can also be created (Figure 2.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Galaxy workflow editor view of a Galaxy workflow that runs the same tool (RXLR Motifs) with three different settings, and compares the results using a Venn diagram (reproduced from Cock et al. (2013)). The workflow runs from left to right. A single Input dataset is fed into the RXLR Motifs tool three times, applying a different method each time. Each run of the RXLR Motifs tool generates a different set of output sequences, which are passed as input to the Filter tool. The output from all three runs of the Filter tool is passed to the Venn Diagram tool, along with the original input dataset, to generate a Venn Diagram\n\n\n\nUsing Galaxy, you will build up a powerful bioinformatic analysis workflow to analyse your data, step-by-step, using a web browser. Galaxy allows you to save and share your workflows, to encourage reuse and reproducibility.",

Click on the You can load your own data link under This history is empty. This will bring up a dialogue box. You can drag and drop a file or files into the dialogue box, or use the Choose local file button to navigate to the location of your files.\n\nClick on the You can load your own data link.\nDrag the three workshop data files starting with SARS_AY278741 into the dialogue box.\nClick on the Start button.\nThe files will appear in the History sidebar.\nClick the Close button in the file dialogue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData file colours\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the data files are first added to the workflow, they have a grey background. This indicates that Galaxy knows about the files, and is preparing to upload them.\nWhen Galaxy begins to upload the files, the background changes to orange.\nWhen the upload is complete, the background turns green.\nIf there is a problem with uploading, the background turns red (please signal to a demonstrator if this happens for you).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData file types\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will have noticed the Auto-detect dropdown boxes when you uploaded your files. Galaxy is able to process files that describe many data types, including genome sequence data, transcriptome data, mass spectrometry data, and so on. Each individual file contains a single type of data.\nGalaxy is usually clever enough to determine for itself what data is in a particular file, but sometimes it cannot recognise the contents, and you may have to specify the file type by choosing from the options in this drop-down box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo: Uploading files with the You can load your own data link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Use the Upload Data button in the Tools sidebar\nThere is an Upload button at the top left of the Galaxy window, in the left-most toolbar.

We preload this data in the setup cell (see source code), and you can interact with it below with the code:\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"reporter_curves.csv\")\nglimpse(data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigate Palmer’s Penguins\n\n\n\n\n\nThe penguins dataset contains data about three different species of penguins. Take a look at the format of the dataset:\nglimpse(penguins)\nYou’ll see there are eight variables, including species, weight, sex, etc. - some of these variables are categorical (i.e. a category, like species), and others are continuous (i.e. numerical). You can see a visual overview of how the data is related using the plot() function:\nplot(penguins)\nWe can visualise the number of penguins of each species in a bar chart:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(species, fill=species)) +\n         geom_bar()\nfig\nAnd break this down in a facet plot, by sex:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(species, fill=species)) +\n         geom_bar() +\n         facet_wrap(~sex)\nfig\nWe can make a box and whisker plot of penguin body mass by species:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=species, y=body_mass_g, fill=species)) +\n         geom_boxplot()\nfig\nAnd plot the body mass for each sex side-by-side\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=species, y=body_mass_g, fill=sex)) +\n         geom_boxplot()\nfig\nWe can investigate correlations, such as between body mass and flipper length:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm)) +\n         geom_point()\nfig\nWe can colour datapoints by species:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm, colour=species)) +\n         geom_point()\nfig\nAnd fit a linear regression to each species separately:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm, colour=species)) +\n         geom_point() +\n         geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")\nfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nR comes with a number of example datasets you can practice with, including:\n\nmtcars: fuel consumption and other statistic for 32 automobiles\nTitanic: information on the fate of passengers on the fatal maiden voyage of the ocean liner Titanic\n\nYou can see a full list by running the command\nlibrary(help = \"datasets\")",

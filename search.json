The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was isolated by early January, and by the end of January 2020 human-to-human transmission had been confirmed, and cases had been reported in Thailand, Japan, the USA, and several other countries (Figure 1.1, Wang et al.

COVID-19 vaccines are estimated to have prevented an additional 14-20mn deaths worldwide in 2021 (Watson et al. (2022)).\nIn May 2023, the World Health Organisation (WHO) ended their Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), but the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains in circulation. As we begin this workshop, SARS-CoV-2 has claimed over 7mn lives (Mathieu et al. (2020)).",

    "text": "1.3 SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) Protein\nThe spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a central role in host cell receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion (Huang et al. (2020)). The protein comprises two subunits:\n\nS1: a receptor-binding domain that recognises and binds ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2)\nS2: a domain that mediates membrane fusion between the virus and the cell by forming a structural bundle\n\nwhich interact with the host cell as illustrated in Figure 1.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: (a) The schematic structure of the S protein. (b) The S protein binds to the receptor ACE2. (c) The binding and virus–cell fusion process mediated by the S protein. (d) The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells (reproduced from Huang et al. (2020))\n\n\n\nWhen you assemble, annotate, and visualise the SARS-CoV-2 genome in this workshop you will find the spike protein annotated as in Figure 1.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: JBrowse rendering of an annotated SARS-CoV-2 genome\n\n\n\nThe spike protein is not the only important surface protein for SARS-CoV-2. The envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid proteins are also essential for the virus to interact with the host, as shown in Figure 1.5, and you will identify these in your analysis today, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: How SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the surface proteins of the target cell (Marta Palma Rodríguez)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther SARS-CoV-2 Structures\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find an interactive collection of publicly-available SARS-CoV-2 protein structures at RCSB/PDB, the public repository for biological structural data.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 PDB Structures",

    "title": "1  Introduction",
    "section": "1.4 Data Provenance",
    "text": "1.4 Data Provenance\nModern scientific research, and this workshop, are both made possible due to the dedication of scientists around the globe to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible) principles for scientific data management.\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 sequence and structural data was released through public repositories including NCBI, GISAID, and RCSB/PDB. The data shared through these resources enabled scientists across the world to conduct research that reduced suffering and hastened the end of the pandemic. These practices were established before COVID-19, and continue to support and empower scientific research globally.\n\n1.4.1 The first sequenced human COVID-19 case\nThe first SARS-CoV-2 genome was obtained from a sample of human lung in January 2020. The sample was sequenced and submitted to NCBI as SAMN13922059. It is recorded as “human lung metagenome” because the entire material - human, virus, and everything else - was sequenced as a single sample. The work as described in Wu et al. (2020) is outlined below.\n\nThe lung was lavaged (washed/rinsed) and the fluid collected\nTotal RNA was extracted from the fluid, and an RNA sequencing library constructed (including depletion of ribosomal RNA)\nThe library was sequenced on an Illumina MiniSeq machine, to give 150bp paired-end reads\nThe resulting reads were cleaned and assembled using Megahit (Li et al. (2015)) and Trinity\nThe longest contig was identified as a coronavirus, and used to design primers for PCR-RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends, Pal (2022), Figure 1.6) to sequence the ends of the virus genome\nThe cleaned reads were remapped against the full virus sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: PCR-RACE generates long amplicons from the viral genome, which can be sequenced with long-read sequencing. This results in a “crenellated” assembly of overlapping long genomic sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nWhy did they extract RNA and not DNA?\nWhy do you think they depleted the ribosomal RNA?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, so we must sequence RNA to recover virus sequence.\nThere is so much ribosomal RNA in biological material that, if it was left in the sample, it would dominate over the viral material and any human transcripts, making the virus more difficult to detect. Depleting it enhances sensitivity for detecting viral RNA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 SARS-CoV-2 read data for this workshop\nFor this workshop, we took all 57mn raw sequencing reads from Wu et al. (2020), which are available at NCBI under accession SRR10971381, and filtered out all reads that matched the human genome. The remaining reads in the files below are those you will use to assemble the SARS-CoV-2 genome.\n\nPaired-end reads, forward direction\nPaired-end reads, reverse direction\n\n\n\n1.4.3 SARS-CoV 2003 genome data for this workshop\nThe first comparator genome in the workshop is that of SARS coronavirus Urbani. This coronavirus emerged in Guangdong, China, in late 2002 and was the subject of a World Health Organisation global alert, which named it SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). This strain of SARS-CoV was sequenced in 2003 (Rota et al. (2003)) and has accession AY278741.1 at GenBank/NCBI.\nIn the workshop, you will use the following files:\n\nSARS 2003 genome sequence (.fasta)\nSARS 2003 annotation (.gff3)\nSARS 2003 combined genome sequence and annotation (.gbk)\n\n\n\n1.4.4 March 2020 Dutch SARS-CoV-2 isolate\nThe second comparator genome you will use in this workshop is a SARS-CoV-2 variant sequenced in the Netherlands in March 2020, four months after the first known human cases were identified. The sample has accession SAMEA6847958 and was obtained through active surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic (Oude Munnink et al. (2020)).\nThe data describes a set of Oxford Nanopore (ONT) GridION reads, which are available under accession ERR4164769 at SRA/NCBI. In the workshop, you will use the following file:\n\nGridION reads for March 2020 Dutch isolate\n\n\n\n\n\nHuang, Yuan, Chan Yang, Xin-Feng Xu, Wei Xu, and Shu-Wen Liu. 2020. “Structural and Functional Properties of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein: Potential Antivirus Drug Development for COVID-19.” Acta Pharmacol.
